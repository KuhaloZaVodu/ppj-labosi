# PPJ Compiler Project

This repository contains the source code for a compiler we're building as part of our university course. The project involves designing and implementing a custom compiler from scratch, covering various stages such as lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

## Features
- Lexical analyzer generator script
- Lexical analysis to tokenize input
- Parsing based on context-free grammar
- Semantic analysis for type checking and scope validation
- Intermediate code generation
- Optimizations for efficiency
- Target code generation

## Requirements
- g++ 9.3.0

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KuhaloZaVodu/ppj-labosi.git
   ```
2. Build and run the compiler:
   ```
   Coming soon...
   ```
